# Welcome to Melis Tuncer's Personal Journal
This is my personal journal website created for presenting my projects.

## Computer Game Creation | Object-Oriented Programming, Python (2021)
This project aims to create a computer game from scratch using object-oriented programming in Python. With my project team, we made a game in which the player shifts right or left while the car is moving on its way. On the way, the player encounters some obstacles that need to be avoided and some boosters that need to be caught. As time passes, the car accelerates and the function of the buttons changes at random moments.

* [See the source code and play the game here](Intermediate_Programming__Car_Game/game.py).
* [See the project report including class diagram, use case diagram, collaboration diagrams, and user documentation here](Intermediate_Programming__Car_Game/project_report.pdf).

## Transshipment Problem | Linear Programming & Mixed Integer Programming, GAMS (2021)
The final project of the Operations Research course required solving several transshipment problems with different settings using Linear and Mixed Integer Programming. The questions were modeled and solved using GAMS software.

## Single Machine Scheduling Problem | Linear Programming & Nonlinear Programming, Pulp (2022)
In this project, a single-machine scheduling problem was solved using two different formulations: a linear and a nonlinear formulation. The objective was to schedule five different jobs given their processing times and due dates.

* [See the jupyter notebook with source codes here](Operations_Research__Single_Machine_Scheduling/jupyter_notebook.html).

## Markov Chains | Monte-Carlo Simulation, R (2022)
This project aimed to find steady-state distributions of 3 Markov chains using two methods: monte-carlo simulation and matrix multiplication.  

* [See the project report and analysis here](Operations_Research__Markov_Chains/project_report.pdf).
* [See the R studio script here](Operations_Research__Markov_Chains/r_source_code.R).

## Systems Simulation | Siman Program, ARENA (2022)
This project simulates a call center queuing system with two servers and different customer types. ARENA simulation software is utilized with SIMAN program models. The system is simulated for eight hours with four replications and the system statistics are reported.

## Facility Design and Planning, Excel (2022)
This project aims to find the optimum layout for a flexible manufacturing system consisting of 6 machines, 1 buffer area, and 1 AGV. There are 5 parts that undergo different operations on different machines in a certain sequence. The first part of the project aims to find the optimum layout for machines and buffer area so that the total distance traveled by parts is minimized. Given the facility layout, the second part of the project aims to find the optimum number of AGVs to be used by utilizing 4 different methods.

## Quality Engineering | Image Processing, Python (2023)
In the context of quality engineering, the project aims to find the defects in the linen fabric using their images. Using statistics and quality engineering concepts such as X-bar chart, S chart, R chart and the like, images are processed pixel by pixel.

* [See the images to be processed here](Quality_Engineering__Image_Processing/linen_images).

## Nonlinear Optimization | Self Organizing Maps for Traveling Salesman Problem, Python (2023)
This project aims to find an optimum route for traveling 81 cities in Turkey, minimizing the total distance traveled, using self-organizing maps (SOM). Different activation functions are utilized while the number of neurons is kept increasing until convergence.

* [See the cities and their locations here](Traveling_Salesman_Problem/ETSPData.txt).
