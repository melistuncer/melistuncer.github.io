# Welcome to Melis Tuncer's Personal Journal
This is my personal journal website created for presenting my projects.

## Computer Game Creation (2021) | Object-Oriented Programming | Python
The final project of our Intermediate Programming Course was to create a computer game from scratch using object-oriented programming in Python. With my project team, we made a game in which the player shifts right or left while the car is moving on its way. On the way, the player encounters some obstacles that need to be avoided and some boosters that need to be caught. As time passes, the car accelerates and the function of the buttons changes at random moments.

## Transshipment Problem (2021) | Linear Programming & Mixed Integer Programming | GAMS
The final project of the Operations Research course required solving several transshipment problems with different settings using Linear and Mixed Integer Programming. The questions were modeled and solved using GAMS software.

## Single Machine Scheduling Problem (2022) | Linear Programming & Nonlinear Programming | Pulp
In this project, a single-machine scheduling problem was solved using two different formulations: a linear and a nonlinear formulation. The objective was to schedule five different jobs given their processing times and due dates.

* [See the jupyter notebook with source codes here](Operations_Research__Single_Machine_Scheduling/jupyter_notebook.html).

## Markov Chains (2022) | Monte-Carlo Simulation | R
This project aimed to find steady-state distributions of 3 Markov chains using two methods: monte-carlo simulation and matrix multiplication.  

* [See the project report and analysis here](Operations_Research__Markov_Chains/project_report.pdf)
* [See the R studio script here](Operations_Research__Markov_Chains/r_source_code.R).

## Systems Simulation (2022) | Siman Program | ARENA 
This project simulates a call center queuing system with two servers and different customer types. ARENA simulation software is utilized with SIMAN program models. The system is simulated for eight hours with four replications and the system statistics are reported.
